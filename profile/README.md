# ðŸ§¬ Project Peptify

> Predicting Antimicrobial Peptides from Protein Sequences

Peptify is an independent research and engineering initiative to explore how we can use machine learning to predict antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) from raw protein sequences. We're starting simple: fast data exploration, visualizations, and basic classifiers.

Our goal?  
To better understand the sequence-function relationship of AMPs â€” and maybe, just maybe, design better therapeutics in the future.

## ðŸŒŸ Mission

- Build open, accessible tools for peptide discovery.
- Combine computational and biological insights to map the AMP landscape.
- Learn, ship, and share our findings to contribute to the wider research community.

## ðŸš€ MVP Goals

- âœ… Parse FASTA datasets of known antimicrobial peptides.
- âœ… Visualize amino acid distributions and simple embeddings.
- âœ… Train baseline classifiers (logistic regression, etc.).
- âœ… Explore sequence embeddings (e.g., ProtBERT, SeqVec).
- âœ… Document our findings in public, as an ongoing research log.

## âœ¨ Why We Started

> Because the gap between biology and computation is too wide â€” and we believe that with a small, fast team and open curiosity, we can build tools that help researchers and practitioners explore protein spaces more intuitively.

Peptify is our gift to the field, and our way to learn deeply by doing.
